    "Object-oriented programming revolves around the notion of objects, which are constructs that may have associated data, which are called attributes, and logical functions, which are called methods. An object is an instance of a class. A class describes the functioning of an object, and is what you actually write. A class can be compared to a data type. An object is an instance of a class, and implements it. All but a few data types you are likely familiar with, are classes under the hood; for example, a variable `arr = np.ndarray([1, 2, 3])` is an instance of the class `np.ndarray`."
